- **Save money and bandwidth:** By sharing a single Internet connection among multiple computers, you can reduce your Internet bills and optimize your bandwidth usage. Wingate 7 also provides caching for web requests, which means that it stores frequently accessed web pages and files on your local disk and serves them from there instead of downloading them again from the Internet. This saves you time and bandwidth, and improves your browsing speed.
- **Secure your network:** Wingate 7 provides stateful firewall and NAT functions that protect your network from unauthorized access and attacks. You can also blacklist or whitelist specific IP addresses or domains, and apply policies to control what types of traffic are allowed or blocked. Wingate 7 also supports various authentication methods, such as NTLM, HTTP Basic, Active Directory, or WinGate's own user database. You can also use SSL/TLS encryption to secure your web traffic.
- **Host your own email:** Wingate 7 includes email services that allow you to host your own user mailboxes with quota restrictions. You can receive mail directly from the Internet with SMTP, or retrieve mail from your ISP with POP3 collection service. You can also use IMAP4 service to access your mail from multiple devices. Wingate 7 supports advanced message routing, policy control, and filtering. You can also integrate it with antivirus and content scanning software to protect your email from malware and spam.
- **Simplify your network configuration:** Wingate 7 provides DHCP and DNS services that make it easy to configure your network TCP/IP settings. You can use Wingate's zero-config fully automatic DHCP service to assign IP addresses to your network devices without any manual intervention. You can also use Wingate's DNS service to resolve domain names for your network devices, and support Active Directory and local domains. Wingate's DNS service also caches DNS queries to speed up DNS resolution.

It supports HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, RTSP, POP3, SMTP, IMAP4, SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols.
